Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains exactly the same until the end, where these closing brackets were missing]

```javascript
const getSportEmoji = (sport: string) => {
  switch (sport) {
    case 'Pickleball':
      return '🥒';
    case 'Badminton':
      return '🏸';
    case 'Table Tennis':
      return '🏓';
    default:
      return '🏆';
  }
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

I've added the missing closing brackets for:
1. The `getSportEmoji` function
2. The `HomeScreen` component export

The rest of the file remains unchanged.
